# Deep Learning Specialization
*******************************************************

This repo contains all the projects and assignments that I have completed as a part of DL specialization on Coursera. The specialization covers pretty much all important DL concepts and algorithms from beginner level upto the Advanced level and provides many excellent assignments along with quizzes, so as to strengthen one's understanding.

**The solutions have been uploaded for personal academic purposes and can be used as a reference by others (but I strongly recommend trying out the assignments on your own).**

## Courses
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)

  - This course covers the basics of Neural Networks. It covers detailed explanation **Forward Propagation, Backward Propagation, Parameters and Hyperparameters**.
  - It also gives a good amount of practice of working with the **Numpy** package via programming assignments involving building shallow and deep NNs.
  
- [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)

  - This course addresses many issues that one faces while using DeepNets, including **Vanishing and Exploding Gradients, and Bias and Variance problems**, and suggests many ways to tackle it.
  - It covers different Initialization techniques like **Xavier and He initialization** and different Regularization techniques like **L2 Regularization and Dropout**.
  - Many Advanced Optimization methods like **Momentum, RMSprop, and Adam** are also discussed in this course.
  - **TensorFlow**, a very popular Deep Learning Framework, usage is also taught in this course. 

- [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning)

  - It introduces the ways of carrying out **Error Analysis**, an important step in improving any ML system.
  - It sheds light on concepts of **Bayes Optimal Error and Human-level performance** and describes ways of identifying bias and variance using these concepts.
  - This course also talks in detail about **Train, Dev, and Test sets and the problem of mis-matched datasets**.
  - Lastly, it also covers very important techniques like **Transfer Learning, Multi-task Learning
